>LLMSecOps (Large Language Model Security Operations) is an emerging discipline focused on integrating security best 
> practices throughout the lifecycle of LLMs—mirroring how DevSecOps brings security into every stage of software 
> development. LLMSecOps aims to ensure that LLMs are robust, trustworthy, and resilient against evolving threats, 
> from data collection and model development to deployment, monitoring, and decommissioning.



**Key Goals of LLMSecOps**

- Protect LLM systems from data poisoning, model theft, prompt injection, adversarial attacks, and supply chain vulnerabilities


- Ensure trust, compliance, and auditability in LLM models and their outputs


- Embed security checks and continuous monitoring throughout the LLM pipeline, including CI/CD, deployment, and inference

## llm 3 types of models


<img src="img/3_types_of_models.png" alt="Project Logo"/>

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be categorized into three main types based on their underlying architecture and primary
use cases: **Autoregressive Models**, **Autoencoding Models**, and **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models**.
Here’s a clear overview of each:

## Types of LLMs

| Type                        | Description                                                                                       | Example Models     | Best For                                    |
|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Autoregressive Models       | Generate text one token at a time by predicting the next token based on previous ones.            | GPT series, Claude | Text generation, chatbots, creative writing |
| Autoencoding Models         | Learn to understand context by reconstructing masked parts of input text (masked language model). | BERT, RoBERTa      | Text understanding, classification, NER     |
| Sequence-to-Sequence Models | Transform one sequence into another, often using encoder-decoder architecture.                    | T5, BART, MarianMT | Translation, summarization, Q\&A            |

### **Autoregressive Models**

- **How they work:** Predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words, generating text left-to-right.
- **Strengths:** Excellent at generating fluent, coherent text.
- **Limitations:** May lose coherence in long outputs, can hallucinate facts.
- **Examples:** GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude.


### **Autoencoding Models**

- **How they work:** Mask parts of the input and train the model to reconstruct the missing parts using context from both sides.
- **Strengths:** Superior at understanding language, context, and meaning.
- **Limitations:** Not designed for generating long, coherent text.
- **Examples:** BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT.


### **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models**

- **How they work:** Use an encoder to process the input sequence and a decoder to generate the output sequence.
- **Strengths:** Ideal for tasks where input and output are both sequences, such as translation or summarization.
- **Limitations:** Require more complex training and fine-tuning.
- **Examples:** T5, BART, MarianMT.

These three types form the foundation of most modern LLMs, and many advanced models combine elements from each to
achieve better performance across a wider range of tasks.


## Architecture risks


| Risk                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recursive Pollution       | LLMs can produce incorrect output with high confidence. If such output is used in training data, it can cause future LLMs to be trained on polluted data, creating a feedback loop problem.        |
| Data Debt                 | LLMs rely on massive datasets, often too large to thoroughly vet. This lack of transparency and control over data quality presents a significant risk.                                             |
| Black Box Opacity         | Many critical components of LLMs are hidden in a "black box" controlled by foundation model providers, making it difficult for users to manage and mitigate risks effectively.                     |
| Prompt Manipulation       | Manipulating the input prompts can lead to unstable and unpredictable LLM behavior. This risk is similar to adversarial inputs in other ML systems.                                                |
| Poison in the Data        | Training data can be contaminated intentionally or unintentionally, leading to compromised model integrity. This is especially problematic given the size and scope of data used in LLMs.          |
| Reproducibility Economics | The high cost of training LLMs limits reproducibility and independent verification, leading to a reliance on commercial entities and potentially unreviewed models.                                |
| Model Trustworthiness     | The inherent stochastic nature of LLMs and their lack of true understanding can make their output unreliable. This raises questions about whether they should be trusted in critical applications. |
| Encoding Integrity        | Data is often processed and re-represented in ways that can introduce bias and other issues. This is particularly challenging with LLMs due to their unsupervised learning nature.                 |
